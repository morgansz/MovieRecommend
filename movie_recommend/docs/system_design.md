## Implementation approach:
For this movie recommendation application, we can use the Django framework to build the backend and React.js for the frontend. Django provides a robust and scalable web framework, while React.js allows for the creation of interactive and responsive user interfaces. We can also use the TMDb API to obtain movie information and ratings.

## Python package name:
```python
"movie_recommendation"
```

## File list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "views.py",
    "serializers.py",
    "urls.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "static/css/style.css",
    "static/js/app.js"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:

        -int id
        -str username
        -str password
        -str email
        +Profile profile
        +List<Movie> favorite_movies

        +List<Recommendation> recommendations
        +search_movies(query: str) -> List<Movie>

    class Recommendation{

        -Movie movie
    }
    User "1" -- "1" Profile: has
    User "1" -- "*" Movie: favorite_movies
    User "1" -- "*" Rating: ratings
    User "1" -- "*" Recommendation: recommendations
    Movie "1" -- "*" Actor: actors
    Movie "1" -- "*" Rating: ratings
    Movie "1" -- "*" Recommendation: recommendations
    Rating "1" -- "1" User: user
    Rating "1" -- "1" Movie: movie
    Recommendation "1" -- "1" User: user
    Recommendation "1" -- "1" Movie: movie
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as U
    participant Profile as P
    participant Movie as M
    participant Actor as A
    participant Rating as R
    participant Recommendation as Rec

    U->>+M: search_movies(query)
    M-->>-U: List<Movie>

    U->>+M: rate_movie(movie, rating)
    M-->>-U: Rating

    U->>+M: favorite_movies
    M-->>-U: List<Movie>

    U->>+R: ratings
    R-->>-U: List<Rating>

    U->>+Rec: recommendations
