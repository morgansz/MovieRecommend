## Logic Analysis:
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application"),
    ("models.py", "Contains the database models for User, Profile, Movie, Actor, Rating, and Recommendation"),
    ("views.py", "Contains the view functions for handling HTTP requests"),
    ("serializers.py", "Contains the serializers for converting model instances to JSON and vice versa"),
    ("urls.py", "Contains the URL patterns for routing requests to the appropriate view functions"),
    ("templates/index.html", "Contains the HTML template for the frontend"),
    ("static/css/style.css", "Contains the CSS styles for the frontend"),
    ("static/js/app.js", "Contains the JavaScript code for the frontend")
]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "serializers.py",
    "views.py",
    "urls.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "static/css/style.css",
    "static/js/app.js"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point of the application.
The 'models.py' file contains the database models for User, Profile, Movie, Actor, Rating, and Recommendation.
The 'views.py' file contains the view functions for handling HTTP requests.
The 'serializers.py' file contains the serializers for converting model instances to JSON and vice versa.
The 'urls.py' file contains the URL patterns for routing requests to the appropriate view functions.
The 'templates/index.html' file contains the HTML template for the frontend.
The 'static/css/style.css' file contains the CSS styles for the frontend.
The 'static/js/app.js' file contains the JavaScript code for the frontend.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There is no mention of how the frontend and backend will communicate. We need to clarify if the frontend will make API requests to the backend or if the backend will serve the frontend as static files.
